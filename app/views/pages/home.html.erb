          <h3>This is Paragraph 1</h3>
          This is the first paragraph in my html page. This html page is for an assignment. I have used CSS features to align this. ALso used flex to make the columns.
        </div>

      <div class="column">
          <h3>This is Paragraph 2</h3>
          This is the second paragraph. We were told to make two paragraphs or this instruction. I used the picture of the overall to design it this way.
